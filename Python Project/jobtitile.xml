Tom and Don started with just three Shell service stations in Burnsville, Minnesota. Despite these humble beginnings, we had a simple, yet ambitious goal from the start: To redefine the entire auto repair industry. Today, (together with our parent company Bridgestone Retail Operations), we have grown into the largest automotive repair center chain in the country. We are currently hiring for the position of: Retail Sales Teammate If you’re looking for a career with an industry leader that promotes heavily from within its own ranks, then you should keep reading! Our sales associates have significant opportunities to advance within our store management ranks due to our accelerated career path. In fact, our goal is to develop and advance talented retail sales associates to a store management position within 2-5 years. If this peaks your interest, wait until you hear the best part: Most of our store managers receive a total compensation of between $60,000 to $100,000 or more + benefits! In our performance based culture our store managers earn a competitive salary and a bonus based on their store’s profitability. But first, a little bit more about us… As today’s consumers continue to hold on to their vehicles for a longer and longer period of time, they increasingly trust and depend on us to maintain what is often their lifeline and second largest investment. In fact, our unique business model actually makes us one of the few retailers that can excel in an economic recession or expansion. We have nearly 500 stores in 23 states and we’re continually opening new stores each year. Together with Bridgestone Retail Operations, our parent company, we have more than 2,200 company stores in the US alone, which makes us the largest automotive aftermarket retailer in the US and the world! Aside from being the industry leader, we provide outstanding compensation and rewarding careers. This includes a full line-up of benefits, including a 401K plan, and a commitment to ongoing training and professional development including an accelerated career path to management positions. We operate each store as an individual profit center and our store managers are responsible for running a million+ dollar business! Our sales associates gain an expansive view of our retail business operations and have significant insight into store level operations. So you may be saying to yourself, “This sounds great, but I don’t know anything about car repair!” That’s OKAY! We MUCH prefer to hire people with the right ATTITUDE, PASSION, DRIVE, and CUSTOMER CENTRIC OUTLOOK. We can teach the necessary automotive skills, but we CANNOT teach these listed qualities! In fact, many of our most successful managers and sales teammates joke that they didn’t know a steering wheel from a brake pad before they joined our team! Our Education and Development Programs: All sales associates attend our New Teammate Orientation (NTO) where our talented automotive education managers provide a one week course and outline of our business. Our sales associates also complete our best in the industry 12 week automotive management training program in their store and have access to ongoing education courses as they progress through our organization. The million dollar question: Do you have an outgoing personality, an entrepreneurial spirit, and a drive to succeed rapidly in a performance based culture? Maybe you’re tired of just “sitting behind a desk.” If you are looking for a career with unlimited potential as opposed to just another J-O-B. then this may be the opportunity you’ve been waiting for.
